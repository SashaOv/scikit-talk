# Agile Machine Learning with Python and scikit-learn
Materials from the [talk](http://www.siliconvalley-codecamp.com/Session/2014/agile-machine-learning-with-scikit-learn) 
I did at [Silicon Valley CodeCamp 2014](http://www.siliconvalley-codecamp.com/)

To use the notebook:

  1. Install [iPython](http://ipython.org/)
  2. Install [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/) and the prerequisites. The easiest way is to use a prepackaged 
distribution like (Anaconda)[https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/] or 
(Canopy)[http://www.enthought.com/products/canopy]
  3. From the command line:
         
         # clone the project 
         > git clone https://github.com/SashaOv/scikit-talk.git
         # Change into the project's directory
         > cd scikit-talk
         # Run the ipython notbook
         > ipython notebook
         > ipython notebook
       
  4. As the notebook screen opens, click on the **Talk.ipynb** entry
  5. Work through the notebook step by step by pressing SHIFT-ENTER in each cell.
